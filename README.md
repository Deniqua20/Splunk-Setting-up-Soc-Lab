# Splunk: Setting Up a SOC Lab 🚀

In this project, I completed a **TryHackMe SOC lab** where I installed and configured the **Splunk Universal Forwarder** on both **Linux** and **Windows** machines. This setup allowed me to forward logs from endpoints into a central Splunk server for real-time monitoring and analysis.
